                <li> Realization of a Facebook chatbot: as part of a project in connection with a startup (cocotefood), we had to make a chatbot that can respond to the answers of potential customers in an automatic way.  </li>
                <li> Development of a small game under IOS as part of a Uv on development under XCODE. </li>
                <li> Realization of a portfolio manager under excel VBA. We targeted 5 pairs of Forex currencies and we made a small application. The goal was to be able to give the risk and the expectation of gain associated with the configuration (share of the portfolio invested in each currency) that the client chooses.</li>
                <li> Development of a trading bot under python. We chose 3 indicators and the goal was to make backtest since 2017 on one hour candles to test our strategy. Interesting project for us, because it mixes Data collection (all the information of one-hour candlestick closes since 2017 and on several crypto-currencies), testing of different strategies, and satisfaction of the results. We are currently working on a second version that would include neural networks and allow the bot to become self-intelligent.
